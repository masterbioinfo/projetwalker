Shift2Me Project - Dating site for proteins !!!

This program can calculate chimicals shifts of 15N and 1H during a portein protein interaction in fonction of titation of the secondary protein. 
He generate plots to show chemicals shifts for each titration of the secondary protein. You can fix a cutoff to appreciate residus involved in protein protein interaction. 
You can see all chemical shift of interest 2D maps (N15/1H) too.
